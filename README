stream2hooks holds a Twitter streaming API connection and calls a webhook for each tweet.

It is set up like a Heroku python app. For details on that, refer to this article:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python

You'll need to set these environment variables: (which if you use foreman, you can put in a .env file)
PORT
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

If you already have virtualenv and foreman (included with the Heroku toolbelt) installed,
these 4 commands should get you started:

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
foreman start

In order to start the stream, send a POST request to /fetch where the body is a JSON document containing
two parameters: stream_url and webhook_url. For example:

{"stream_url": "/1.1/statuses/filter.json?track=%23twitter", "webhook_url": "http://localhost/tweet"}
